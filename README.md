![Collection Classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rotexsoft/versatile-collections/master/versatile-collections.png)

Use or extend the `GenericCollection` class to create collections that can contain items of differing types.

Extend the `StrictlyTypedCollection` class or any of its sub-classes to create collections that will only contain 
items of the same type (e.g. instances of the same class, ints, floats, etc).
